##### HOW TO READ RESULTS
*example:* model_based_5_it_x_20_cols, means **model based** method applied for **5 iterations** each of **20 columns** of degradation (apart from the first which is of only 1 row/column), so in this example we have a total of 4x20 = 80 degradated columns.


**Column** degradation means degradating **time** axis, while **Rows** degradation refers to **frequency** axis.
